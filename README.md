# Crop Suitability Modeling using GEE
According to the United Nations (U.N.), an estimated 925 million people are suffering from hunger. Additionally, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2050, a 60% increase in food production will be required to feed a global population of 9.3 billion people. Finally, agriculture is one of the sectors most affected by climate change, a phenomenon that isolates farmers, mainly small-scale ones, from formerly agricultural lands. To meet these challenges head on, farmers need to know what crops will grow best on their land and prepare for future climate change impacts. 

## Introduction:
The objective of this project is to indentify areas with the optimal environmental conditions for growing sweet corn. The study area for this project is the United States. Optimal suitability is mapped using historic and future climate data to illustrate how climate change will impact which area are expected to have optimal suitability in the future. The results will indicate which areas have histoically had the optimal environmental conditions for growing sweet corn and if they are expected to persist in the future. Areas where the optimal environmental conditions are not expected to persitst may want to consider planting different cultivars or crop species. In the end, the results are intended to inform farmers in the identified areas about the potential climate change impacts and prepare them for these impacts. 

## Methods:
The crop suitability model was developed using Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE is a web-based software that runs in your browser and is free for those who have a google account and sign up for it. GEE allows users to generate code using the Javascript programming language to do geographic analysis on publicly available datasets stored in Google's cloud platform. To begin, the first thing that we need to do is import the climate and soil image collections and select the relevent bands that we need.
