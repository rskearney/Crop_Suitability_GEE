# Crop Suitability Modeling using GEE
According to the United Nations (U.N.), an estimated 925 million people are suffering from hunger. Additionally, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), by 2050, a 60% increase in food production will be required to feed a global population of 9.3 billion people. Finally, agriculture is one of the sectors most affected by climate change, a phenomenon that isolates farmers, mainly small-scale ones, from formerly agricultural lands. To meet these challenges head on, farmers need to knowing what crops grow best on their land and prepare for future climate conditions.
